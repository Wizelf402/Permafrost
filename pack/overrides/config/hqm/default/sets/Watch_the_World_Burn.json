Botany and other forms of druidic magic tap into the magic of plants and nature to generate mana. Theurgists must rely on higher powers to utilize their abilities.\n\nHowever, there is one exception. Raw, unfiltered, elemental magic. While elementalism itself is complex, the elements themselves are not. The elements are magic in its purest form, able to perform spells that are simple, yet effective... if you can properly harness the elements, of course.\n\n If you do things right, you\u0027ll be able to harness the raw power of fire, a deadly weapon against the Chilled,",
