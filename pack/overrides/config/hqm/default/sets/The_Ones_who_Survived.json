Any Stray, Frozen, Wraith or Elemental counts as a prime target for these young creepers, even more than the player.\n\nOf course, there is a way to weaponize these creepies against the frozen hordes.\n\nCreeper spores are dropped from creepers when they\u0027re blown up by another creeper\u0027s blast, and can be crafted from gunpowder and seeds. These spores, when thrown, produce a spore cloud just like that of the creeper, which starts forming little creepies, which are very eager to blow up the nearest frozen mob that they find.",
