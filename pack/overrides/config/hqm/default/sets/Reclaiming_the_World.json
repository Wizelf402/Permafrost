  "description": "You\u0027ve wandered, alone in the cold, for weeks. But... with this new discovery... something tells you that there may be some hope.\n\nYou can rebuild a little piece of the world. Make it livable... make it into a home. You can pry a piece of the world from the storm\u0027s grasp, and turn it into a veritable fortress."
