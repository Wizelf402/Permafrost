The world is dead.

It's been about a week since the Storm began, and it hasn't shown any signs of stopping. You're beginning to think it'll never let up.

And, as far as you know... you're correct. It never will. This is the Permafrost. The end of everything. The entire world has been frozen over, and as far as you know, everything else is dead.

There's no stopping it. The Permafrost is a primal force of nature, one that struck without warning and killed everything that it could touch. For now, all you can do is survive, and hope that one day the storm passes.

Welcome to the apocalypse.
