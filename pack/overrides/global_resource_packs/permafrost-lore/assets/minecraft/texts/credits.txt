§7Technically, this was a single person project… but we all know that so much more went into all of this. I couldn't have made Permafrost without the help of… well, everyone listed here. Helping me when I couldn't figure things out, showing me the ropes, responding when I contacted them, playtesting, supporting me, even creating things for the modpack itself.
§7I'm so incredibly thankful for everyone who helped me bring this little passion project of mine to life. From the creators of the mods that I used, to the wonderful Minecraft modding community, to the hundreds of people who showed interest in Permafrost… I couldn't have done this without them. I couldn't have done this without YOU.
§7So… yeah. Thank you. For helping me bring this stupid little dream of mine to life.

§7These folks all responded to and worked with me while I was creating this project of mine. I had so many questions and this was all so new to me... but they tolerated me. They answered my questions, despite me probably getting a tad bit annoying. And, well… Without them, I wouldn't've been able to finish this thing.

[C]§fEven in the face of hopelessness, you can find hope. Find something to fight for, and if you can't fight for anything, fight for yourself. Fight just to keep on fighting. Eventually, you'll stumble upon the hope that you'd been missing.
