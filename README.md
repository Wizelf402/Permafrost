# Permafrost (Part of the Eyes of the Storm pack series)

Permafrost is a modpack by Wizelf402, maintained with assistance from the community in the Eyes of the Storm Discord: https://discord.gg/4KZ7x5zqg2

Main contributors are as follows:
- Wizelf402: Main Author of the EotS pack series
- Cocona20xx and Nevada (from the EotS discord): pack debugging and mantaining the github repo
- All the other cool people on the EotS discord who've helped get this show on the road!

**How to use this repo:**

The contained files are the *uncompressed* version of the `permafrost-[VERSION NUMBER].zip` file in the root directory of each branch within the `pack` folder.

To update mod versions, use the Curseforge/GDLauncher programs to modify the `manifest.json` and `modlist.html` files **indirectly**, as modifying them by hand isn't intuitive, sadly.

For the other files (all of which are in the `overrides` folder, copy-paste them into your working install of the pack, and modify them there; or dynlink the files from your local repo to the install of the pack, it's up to you.
